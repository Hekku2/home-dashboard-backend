# Backend side for angular-sailsjs-boilerplate

Backend is a [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org) application without frontend. See more info at http://sailsjs.org/ I have 
just done some small tweaks to generic workflow of sails nothing else. Basically this only serves an API and
user authentication services - nothing else.

This backend code is used on [angular-sailsjs-boilerplate](https://github.com/tarlepp/angular-sailsjs-boilerplate)
